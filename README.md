# ⌨️ Task 04 – Simple Keylogger (Educational)

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates a **basic keylogging mechanism** built strictly for **educational and ethical learning purposes**.  
It focuses on understanding how keystroke capture works at a technical level and highlights the **importance of permissions, transparency, and cybersecurity ethics**.

⚠️ **This project is NOT intended for malicious use.**

---

## 🎯 Objective
- Understand how keystrokes can be captured programmatically
- Learn about input event listeners in Python
- Study real-world security risks related to keyloggers
- Emphasize ethical usage and user consent

---

## 🛠️ Features
- Captures keyboard inputs
- Logs pressed keys into a text file
- Runs locally for testing and learning
- Simple and easy-to-understand logic
- Demonstrates security threats from unauthorized monitoring

---

## 🧠 Key Learning Points
- How keyloggers function at a basic level
- Why keyloggers are considered high-risk malware
- Importance of:
  - User consent
  - Ethical boundaries
  - Secure system design
- How endpoint security tools detect such behavior

---

## ▶️ How It Works (High-Level)
1. The program listens for keyboard events
2. Each keystroke is captured
3. The key data is written to a log file
4. Logging stops when the program is terminated

---

## 📂 Output
- A text file containing recorded keystrokes (for demo/testing only)

---
